Web Application for CUNY transfer Students, Collaborative Project.  

For now  the current web page is on my venus account .   WILL NOT REFLECT ANY CHANGES IMEDIATELY.

We can decide to host it elsewhere (heroku?) later on, but for now this will do.

# Backend information 

We are using Express, a node framework for back end. 
 
 open the package.json file to see which packages you need to npm install. 
 They are under dependencies. 
 
 Views folder contains the html as ejs files for express to render them. 
 folder public contains the css.  WE will allow express to serve this.
