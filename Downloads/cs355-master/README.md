Web Application for CUNY transfer Students, Collaborative Project.  

For now  the current web page is on my venus account . 
https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~vima9953/

We can decide to host it elsewhere (heroku?) later on, but for now this will do. 

Everyone fork this into your git account, and commit your names to the project.  
Good way to ensure that everyone has their git working properly. 


I suggest sourcetree or github desktop to help manage the project.
